HISTORIA INDICA.

οὕνομα. (7) Ἐνταῦθα ξείνια Νεάρχῳ προσφέρουσιν
οἳ κωμῆται πρόὸατα καὶ ἰχθύας· καὶ τῶν προὸάτων τὰ
κρέα λέγει ὅτι ἧν ἰχθυώδεα, ὥς τοῖσι τῶν ὀρνίθων τῶν
πελαγίων , ὅτι καὶ αὐτὰ ἰχθύων σιτέεται· ποίη γὰρ οὐκ
5 ἔνι ἐν τῇ χώρῃ. (8) Ἀλλὰ τῇ ὑστεραίῃ πλώσαντες ἐς
σταδίους διηκοσίους ὁρμίζονται πρὸς αἰγιαλῷ καὶ κώμῃ
ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἐς σταδίους τριήκοντα ἀπεχούσῃ· ἡ μὲν
κώμη Κύσα ἐκαλέετο· Καρὸὶς δὲ τῷ αἰγιαλῷ οὔνομα

. ἧν. (9) Ἐνταῦθα πλοίοισιν ἐπιτυγχάνουσι σμικροῖσιν,
ιο οἷα ἁλιέων εἶναι πλοῖα οὐκ εὐδαιμόνων· αὐτοὺς δὲ οὗ

Κάρμινα, νῆσος Ἰνδική. Τὸ ἐθνικὸν ὤφειλε Καρμιναῖος ,
εὕρηνται δὲ Καρμῖνοι. Hoc nomen quum aperte sit
idem cum Arrianeo et sortasse apud Nostrum reponen-
dum , nulla vero exstet insula in eo loco quem Ptole-
maeus assignat ei, dubium non est, quin ex duobus
ejusdem insulae nominibus duas insulas geographus
excuderit. Porro eandem insulam alii vocarunt Σέλη-
ρα, alii Νόσαλα vel Νόσορα, siquidem huc pertinet
insula quam e regione Balarnorum (Barnorum Arriani)
sitam esse dicit Philostratus l. 1. , ubi haec leguntur:
Προκεῖσθαι δὲ τοῦ χωρίου ( sc. τῶν Βαλάρων ) νῆσον ἱε-
ρὰν, ἣν καλεῖσθαι Σέληρα · καὶ στάδια μὲν ἑκατὸν εἶναι
τῷ πορθμῷ, ’Νηρηίδα δ’ οἰκεῖν ἐν αὐτῇ, δεινὴν δαίμονα·
πολλοὺς γὰρ τῶν πλεόντων ἁρπάζειν καὶ μηδὲ ταῖς ναυσὶ
ξυγχωρεῖν πεῖσμα ἐκ τῆς νήσου βάλλεσθαι. Vel hinc col-
ligas nostram insulam eandem esse cum illa Solis'et

« Nereidis insula, quam Νόσαλα Arrianus c. 31 ( Νόσορα

steph. Byz. ) vocat, et Nearchum adiisse fabularum-
que de ea sparsarum vanitatem demonstrasse narrat
(Cf. Strabo p. 7263 Pliniusl. l. § 973 Mela ΙΙΙ, 73
'compares etiam Pseudocallisth. ΙΙ, 38 p. 89. ΙΙΙ, 17
p. 121). Jam quum prorsus ab his differant, quae
nostro loco de Carmine insula leguntur non deserta,
sed habitata, porro quum fabellam redoleant quae de
navigio repente evanido Arrianus habet ( e. 31, 3 ) ε
persuasum mihi est totum istud de hac re caput, quod
Noster tanquam appendicem suae de Ichthyophagis
narrationi assuit, a genuino Nearchi opere alienum
fuisse et ejusdem generis >prodere additamentum,
cujus specimen aliud supra jam vidimus. Verum in his
quoque Arrianum culpa vacare testis est Strabo, qui
et ipse eadem⁴ in suo Nearcho repperit. Ceterum obji-
ciat aliquis non prorsus consentire cum Arriano de
loco insulae assignando Philostratum. Cui respondeo
primum in universo hoc tractu aliam nullam exstare
insulam, ad quam Nosala referri queat, tum vero
quae de hodierna Asthola recentiores tradunt, prorsus
esse accommoda, unde veteres fabulas explices. Au-
diamus Kempthornium l. l. p. 266 : α Ashtola is a
small desolate island, about four or five miles in cir-
cumserence; situated twelve miles from the coast of
'Mekram Its clisss rise rather abruptly srom the sea to
'the height of about three hundred feet; and it is
inaccessihle except in one place, which is a sandy
beach , about one mile in extent, on the northern si-
de. Great quantities of turtle frequent this island sor
the purpose os depositing their eggs. Nearchus an-
chored oss it, and called it Carnine. He says also, that
he received hospitable entertainmcnt from its inhahi-

Nearcho pagi illius incolae hospitalia munera offerunt
oves etpisces. Carnes earum saporem habuisse quasi
piscium, sicuti carnes avium marinarum, quum et ipsae
oves piscibus alerentur3 gramen enim ea regio non
habet. (8) Atpostridie ducenta stadia emensi ad littus
appulerunt, pagumque repererunt triginta stadiis a
mari distantem pago Cysa nomen erat, littori Carbis.

tants, their presents being cattle and fish; but not a
vestige of any habitation now remains The Arabs
come to this island and kill immense numbers os the·
se turtle‚ not for the purpose of food, for they never
partake of it, considering it as an unclean animal;
but they traffic with the shell to China, where it is ma-
de into a kind of paste, and then into combs‚ orna·
ments etc., in imitation of tortoiseshell. The carcases
of the poor animals are thus strewed about the beach
in all directions, causing a stench so great that it was
scarcely bearable3 in fact, we could smell it some di-
stance off the shore. The only land-animals we could
see an the island were rats, and they were swarming3
they seed chiefly on the dead turtle. This island was
once famous as the rendezvous of the J owasimee pira-
tes; and here they committed many horrid and savage
murders on the crews of the vessels which they captu-
red. The remains of their look-out tower are still vi-
sible3 it is built on a high cliff very difficult to 300355,
and commands an extensive view to seaward. They man
who was looking out having discerned a vessel in the
offing made a signal, when instantly the whole squa-
dron of pirates went in chase; and if they unfortuna-
tely succeeded in taking her, they towed her to the
island ,“ where they plundered her of everything
valuable , massaered the crew, and then burnt hcr :
but since the expedition sent against them in 1820 by
the governor of Bombay, this savage tribe has almost
disappeared. υ Ηί5 adde quae Vincentus ΙΙ, p. 299
affert : «ι Captain Blair writes; (ι We were warned by
the natives at Passence, that it would be dangerous to
approch the island of Asthola, as it was enclmntecst
and that a ship had been turned in a rock. This su-
perstitious story did not deter us ; we visited the island,
found plenty of excellent turtle‚ and saw the rock allu-
ded to, which at a distance had the appearance of a
ship under sail. The story was probably told to pre-
vent our disturbing the turtle; it has however' some
affinity to the tale of Nearchus’ s transport. » Η -
