quit, we are told, that the Lathon discharged itself
into the harbour of the Hesperides; and we find a
small spring actually running into the lake which is
connected with the harbour in quaetion3 and which
might, from the position of the subterranean spring
between it and the mountains to the southward of it,
have received at least a portion of the waters, which
lose themselvoe in a place where the level is higher.
When we find that the Lathon (or hidden stream ) of
Bengazi is (111-0011)· between the mountains and the
harbour, it becomes the more probable that such a
communication may have existed, and wethcr the
little spring which· runs into the lake be a continuation
of the Lathon or not, there appears to be quite suf-
ficient reason for believing that the ancients might
have imagined it was... The lake itself is salt, and in
the summer is nearly dry; while the small stream in
question takes its rise within a few yards of the lake,
and running along a channel of inconsiderable breadth,
bordercd with reeds and rushes, might be mistaken
by a common observer for an inroad of the lake into

’ 1110 sandy soil which bounds it. — On tasting it, how-

ever, we found its water to be fresh, and the current
which is formed by its passage into the lake is very
evident on the slightest examination. ο Cf. Barth.

It was impossible to walle round the edge of these pre·
cipices without calling to mind the description given j
by Scylax of the far-famed garden of the Hesperides...-
This singular formation ‚ so far as we have seen, is
also peculiar to the country in question; and we know ’
01 110 other part of the coast of northern Africa where
the same peculiaritioe of soil are ohservable. We do
not meanto point out any one of these subterranean
gardens as that which will eorrespond in point of ex·
tend to the garden , which this author has mentioned 1
all those we saw were considerably less than the fisth
of a mile in diameter ( the measurement given by Scy·
lax ); and the places which would best agree with the
dimensions in question, are now filled with water suf·
ficiently fresh to be drinkable , and take the form of
romantio little lakes... When we consider that the
places in question are all of them sunk below the sur·
face of the soil, and that the face of the country in ,
which they are found is ovet-spread with brushwood ,
and nowhere perfectly level, it will not be thought t’
extraordinary if some of them should have escaped us ¹
in adiligent and frequently-repeated search. ι —Reu
