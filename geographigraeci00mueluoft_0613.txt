Ἢ
1110 rock in which these 'excavations have been made

is perforated like a honeycomb by the continual action
of the sea. . . In one of the chambers were several Greek
inscriptions which have been written with ink on the
walls; but they 310 now so indistinct , that we could
not succeed in copying more than a few words of one
of thein.... In other parts of the rock were excavated
tombs, some of which were entered by a quadrangu-
Ι131 well, in the manner of‘those common in Egypt...
There can be no doubt that great part of the rock
just described 1135 already been washed away by the
sea, which has here gained considerably on the land;
and several wells are now observable some feet under
water, which were of course originally above its level. ..
We have no hesitation in supposing Tabilba to be the
site ofthe mat-itimce stationes [“Υφαλοι, ὅρμος] ofPto-
lemy. Its position corresponds so well with that assi-
gned to the naval stations in question , and its remains
are so well calculated to induce the belief that they
have originally been appropriated to the defence and
accommodation of a considerable number of men,
that we cannot be sceptical on the occasion. On either
side of the promontory on which the castle has been
built is a small sandy hay, neither of which at present
asfords any shelter for vessels, but from which the
galleys of the ancients might have been easely drawn
up on the beach, when it might not havebeen practi-
cable for them to keep the sea. » Haec vir de his plagis
meritissimus; qui si Stadiasmum novisset, nihil huc
pertinere vidisset Ὑφάλους stationem. Dubitari nequit,

quam Barthius p. 349 0011501 11011 53115 magnum esse

Stadiasmus in 1111110 1130111111 computat stadia 665;
quum a Tabilba nonnisi ad 500 sint stadia, quot satis
10010 exputantur in Itinerario ( 62 mill. z [¹96 stadia).
Errorem autem in nostro maxime loco quaerendum esse,
inde colligitur quod post 20 fere stadia sequitur locus

talis, qualem Stadiasmus describit. Vocatur Bureika
( Barth. ), Braiga (Beechey. )‚ Boareigalz ( Smyth. ).
De eo haec Beecheyus p. 225 : «ι We proceeded on to
Braiga , where we were led to exspect, from the report
of our Arab guides, that we should find a harbour
full as good as that of Tripoly„ Braiga has been a
strongly-fortified post, as appears from the remains
of several well-constructed and spacious 0351105 which
have been erected here. On the western point of the
hay which constitutes the mersa (or harbour ) is some
tolerably highland, on which one of the forts has for-
merly stood3 but which is now so much destroyed
and encumbered 'with rubbish‚ as to offer little inte-
rest on examination. Along the same range of hills are
other remains of building, originally connected with
this fort, part of which we were induced to excavate,
but found the chamber which we cleared to have been
merely a storehause for grain, or ‘a reservoir for pre·
serving water. It had been excavated in the rock, on
the top of the range... We found some Greek and
Roman characters traced in the interior, and the re-
presentation of a ship and a palm-trec. The ground
about this excavation, and, indeed, along the whole
range, was strewed with fragments of pottery and
glass among which we found a brass coin of Augustus
Caesar in a very tolerable state of preservation.... Is
there should prove to be sufficient water in the har-
bour of Braiga‚ it is probable that good anchorago
would be found there, with all winds, behind reefs
of breakers extending across the mouth of it : it may
be easely distinguished by the very high saud-hilis at
the back of it, and by the ruin of the roeky point
mentioned at its western extremity. 'Among these sand
hills are some wells, in which the water, though seve-
ral hunderd seet above the level of the sea , is persect-
ly brackish. 2> Cf. Barth. p. 348, qui ipse ,quoque

dum exstitisse putat, ego autem non amplius fuisse,
