blic buildings; but nothing deserves a particular des-
cription. None of the visible remains can be more
ancient than the time of the Roman emperors. The are
either of disserent sized stones or of brick work. The
sculptured cross on some fragments of white marble
would seem to indicate the existence of the city in
Christian times, and from the mention of Elyros in
Hierocles's list of Cretan citios, then reduced in num·
ber to one and-twenty, there can be but little doubt
that its small port also continued to exist at that time.
On the side of the hill, to the south-east of the city,
are several tombs resembling those ofHaghio Kyrko. ι

Kyrl·,o de quibus ita PashleyusII‚ p. 88: « On co
ming to the w01 st part of the descent we saw before
us the church of Haghio Kyrko and the site of ancient
city in a small plain running down to the sea, surroun·
ded on very other side by rocky hius, ,and presenting,
on a large scale, a form every much like that of a
Greek theatre. Near the sea, where the width of
the plain contracts to about 150 paces, is the church
of the Panaghia ‚ which seems to stand on the site osan
ancient temple. I observed near it fragments of the
shasts of granite columns, and in the walls are several
pieces of white marble, some of which seem to have
been parts ofpediments; others of entablatures. The
inference that this may have been a sane of Dictynna
will not fail to suggest itself to the reader. On the
south-western side of the plain, the lower part of the
hills is covered with sepulchres, not scooped out of
rocks, but each of them a small building, the interior
of which is eight οι· 11100 seet long and six or seven
wide, and the crown os its arch about six feet high.
l'here are perhaps fifty on these tombs : their entrance·
doors are so small as only just to alsord room sor any
one to pass into them. The interior os many os the
tombs is covered over with plaster. n Ceterum ad lianc
